We appreciate your continued participation and the comments you shared on the test server board.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In response to the valuable feedback and suggestions we received, we implemented a multitude of changes during the test period.

Taints will raise this drop chance.\u00a0<br/>Upon defeating Bakragore for the first time, you have an increased chance to drop a\u00a0<em>bag you covet</em>. This chance will keep on increasing further with every kill until you loot a bag from him. Then, your drop chance returns to its original value which is considerably lower than the increased first-kill chance. Each time you subsequently defeat him without receiving a bag, your chances increase again till your next drop.</p>\n<p>Bearing taints also gives you the chance to loot <em>tainted hearts</em> and <em>darklight hearts</em> from regular monsters in Rotten Blood. The higher the number of taints, the higher their drop chance. So, what is their purpose?<br/>Once you have killed Bakragore for the first time, you can use an altar in the Blood Vestibule for a crimson offering:<br/>If you sacrifice 5 tainted hearts, 5 darklight hearts and 50,000,000 gold, you will obtain a <em>bag you covet</em> including a best-in-slot item.</p>\n<p>Defeating Bakragore while suffering from his burden is the only way to have a chance at looting the grand versions of the new best-in-slot weapons. The higher the burden stage, the higher the chance to loot a best-in-slot item from Bakragore and the higher the chance for the weapons to drop as a grand version.</p>\n<p><strong>Promotion Scrolls</strong></p>\n<p>There is another magnificent treasure you can seize from Bakragore: promotion scrolls. The smallest one grants your character 3 promotion points which you can spend in your Wheel of Destiny, the most powerful one bestows a whopping 20 points on your character.\u00a0</p>\n<center><img height=\"35 align=\" src=\"https://static.tibia.com/images/news/rb3891_prop_su23.png\" width=\"161\"/></center>\n<p>The higher the burden stage in your fight, the greater the chance to loot a more potent scroll from Bakragore. Each character above level 51 can only use each type of scroll once, so in total a character can gain 50 additional promotion points this way.</p>\n<p>Of course, there are more valuables and accomplishments which you can bring back with you from this defiled place. We hope you are eager to explore Rotten Blood, to push your limits and reap the glory.</p>\n<p>To the adventurous and the brave,\u00a0<br/>To the inquisitive and the curious,\u00a0<br/>To the stalwart and unyielding who venture to their edge and beyond,</p>\n<p>This is your calling.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>Upcoming next: The dawn of your voyage is approaching on Testa, Testera and Testebra!<br/></em></p>\n<table border=\"2\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-style: dotted;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.1555%; text-align: center;\">Content Teaser 4/4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.1555%; text-align: center;\">Feature Teaser 2/2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></td>\n<tr><td><div style=\"text-align:right;margin-right:10px;\"><a href=\"https://www.tibia.com/forum/?action=thread&amp;threadid=4950245\">\u00bb Comment on this news</a></div></td></tr></tr></table>"

This new feature visually highlights every unlooted corpse. For the first 10 seconds, only authorised looters can see it. If at least one corpse in a stack is unlooted, the stack/field will remain highlighted. The <strong>Loot Highlight</strong> will persist until one of the following three conditions is fulfilled: There was an interaction with the corpse via quickloot, the container of the corpse has been opened, or the corpse underwent decomposition, leading to an uncontainerised state. The <strong>Loot Highlight\u00a0</strong>is optional and can be disabled by going to Options and selecting Interface \u2192 Gamewindow.</p>\n<p><img align=\"right\" height=\"180\" hspace=\"10\" src=\"https://static.tibia.com/images/news/bt_gb.png\" vspace=\"10\" width=\"110\"/></p>\n<p>The <strong>Bosstiary Tracker</strong> is another addition that operates in a similar manner to the established Bestiary Tracker.

You can access this feature in the Options menu under Misc and Gameplay, where you will find two new options named <strong>Auto-Sort Purchases</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Auto-Sort Stash into Containers</strong>. These options are enabled by default. As part of this change, the Manage Loot Containers option will also be renamed to Manage Containers.</p>\n<p>We hope that these convenience features will be welcomed additions!<br/>Your Community Managers</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>Upcoming next week: Stay tuned for the final treasure!</em></p>\n<table border=\"2\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-style: dotted;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.1555%; text-align: center;\">Content Teaser 3/4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.1555%; text-align: center;\">Feature Teaser 2/2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></td>\n<tr><td><div style=\"text-align:right;margin-right:10px;\"><a href=\"https://www.tibia.com/forum/?action=thread&amp;threadid=4950147\">\u00bb Comment on this news</a></div></td></tr></tr></table>"
