Then, your drop chance returns to its original value which is considerably lower than the increased first-kill chance. Each time you subsequently defeat him without receiving a bag, your chances increase again till your next drop.\\nBearing taints also gives you the chance to loot tainted hearts and darklight hearts from regular monsters in Rotten Blood. The higher the number of taints, the higher their drop chance. So, what is their purpose?Once you have killed Bakragore for the first time, you can use an altar in the Blood Vestibule for a crimson offering:If you sacrifice 5 tainted hearts, 5 darklight hearts and 50,000,000 gold, you will obtain a bag you covet including a best-in-slot item.\\nDefeating Bakragore while suffering from his burden is the only way to have a chance at looting the grand versions of the new best-in-slot weapons.

Then, your drop chance returns to its original value which is considerably lower than the increased first-kill chance. Each time you subsequently defeat him without receiving a bag, your chances increase again till your next drop.\\nBearing taints also gives you the chance to loot tainted hearts and darklight hearts from regular monsters in Rotten Blood. The higher the number of taints, the higher their drop chance. So, what is their purpose?Once you have killed Bakragore for the first time, you can use an altar in the Blood Vestibule for a crimson offering:If you sacrifice 5 tainted hearts, 5 darklight hearts and 50,000,000 gold, you will obtain a bag you covet including a best-in-slot item.\\nDefeating Bakragore while suffering from his burden is the only way to have a chance at looting the grand versions of the new best-in-slot weapons.

This chance will keep on increasing further with every kill until you loot a bag from him. Then, your drop chance returns to its original value which is considerably lower than the increased first-kill chance. Each time you subsequently defeat him without receiving a bag, your chances increase again till your next drop.\\nBearing taints also gives you the chance to loot tainted hearts and darklight hearts from regular monsters in Rotten Blood. The higher the number of taints, the higher their drop chance. So, what is their purpose?Once you have killed Bakragore for the first time, you can use an altar in the Blood Vestibule for a crimson offering:If you sacrifice 5 tainted hearts, 5 darklight hearts and 50,000,000 gold, you will obtain a bag you covet including a best-in-slot item.\\nDefeating Bakragore while suffering from his burden is the only way to have a chance at looting the grand versions of the new best-in-slot weapons. The higher the burden stage, the higher the chance to loot a best-in-slot item from Bakragore and the higher the chance for the weapons to drop as a grand version.\\nPromotion Scrolls\\nThere is another magnificent treasure you can seize from Bakragore: promotion scrolls. The smallest one grants your character 3 promotion points which you can spend in your Wheel of Destiny, the most powerful one bestows a whopping 20 points on your character.\\u00a0\\n\\nThe higher the burden stage in your fight, the greater the chance to loot a more potent scroll from Bakragore. Each character above level 51 can only use each type of scroll once, so in total a character can gain 50 additional promotion points this way.\\nOf course, there are more valuables and accomplishments which you can bring back with you from this defiled place.

This chance will keep on increasing further with every kill until you loot a bag from him. Then, your drop chance returns to its original value which is considerably lower than the increased first-kill chance. Each time you subsequently defeat him without receiving a bag, your chances increase again till your next drop.\\nBearing taints also gives you the chance to loot tainted hearts and darklight hearts from regular monsters in Rotten Blood. The higher the number of taints, the higher their drop chance. So, what is their purpose?Once you have killed Bakragore for the first time, you can use an altar in the Blood Vestibule for a crimson offering:If you sacrifice 5 tainted hearts, 5 darklight hearts and 50,000,000 gold, you will obtain a bag you covet including a best-in-slot item.\\nDefeating Bakragore while suffering from his burden is the only way to have a chance at looting the grand versions of the new best-in-slot weapons.
