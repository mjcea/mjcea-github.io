        <h2>Summer Update Changes during Test Server</h2>
            <div class="box_news"> 
                <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="NewsTable"><tr>
<td class="NewsTableContainer"><p><img align="bottom" border="0" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/global/letters/letter_martel_L.gif"/>ast week, <img align="right" height="135" hspace="4" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/updatetreesummer135x135.png" vspace="0" width="135"/>the test phase for the summer update was concluded. We appreciate your continued participation and the comments you shared on the test server board. </p>
<p>In response to the valuable feedback and suggestions we received, we implemented a multitude of changes during the test period. These changes encompassed various aspects of the game and aimed to enhance the overall experience.</p>
<p>In order to give you an overview, we have summarised the most important adjustments for you in this article.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Rotten Blood</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During boss encounters against Chagorz, Vemiath, and Bakragore<strong> </strong>bosses will now drop Rotten Charges every 90 seconds.</li>
<li>Rotten Charges will now be active for 15 seconds.</li>
<li>Whenever a minion of these bosses steps on a Rotten Charge<br/>
<ul type="square">
<ul type="square">
<li>All players within a small radius of the charge will stop to generate fields for 15 seconds.</li>
<li>The respective boss will stop to heal itself on fields for 15 seconds.</li>
<li>All Elder Bloodjaws will be removed from the boss room for 15 seconds.</li>
<li>The resistances of the respective boss will be lowered, now for 15 seconds.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<img align="right" height="64" hspace="10" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/spiritofpurity.gif" vspace="10" width="128"/></li>
<li>Based on your suggestions we have decided to rearrange the taint order and switched taints 2 and 3.</li>
<li>An additional reward was added: you will be able to loot taming items from the various bosses that will enable you to tame a special mount, the Spirit of Purity. A vivid white horse spirit a player can acquire as soon as he defeated Bakragore at least once.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features changes</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" height="200" hspace="10" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/bosstiarytracker_goldenborder.png" vspace="10" width="147"/></p>
<ul>
<li>We have implemented the display of Boss Cooldowns into the new <em>Bosstiary Tracker </em>feature. Hovering over the symbol shows the full cooldown time.</li>
<li>We have added a new category Looted Potions to the <em>Managed Container Extension</em>.</li>
<li>By default, the <em>Managed Container Extension</em> feature is now inactive. If you want to activate it, go to Options -&gt; Misc. -&gt; Gameplay -&gt; Auto-Sort Purchases/Auto-Sort Stash into Containers.</li>
<li>We have included direct links and a promotion points limit to the <em>Wheel of Destiny Planner</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>During the test phase, we also communicated several other changes to hunting grounds, creatures and items that have been implemented.</p>
<p>Thank you again to all those who have offered us constructive feedback and suggestions. Your contribution has been invaluable and we appreciate your dedication and enthusiasm, as well as the time you have taken to share your expectations, aspirations, and concerns with us.</p>

The new weapons will also be obtainable as special versions. The strength of their augment surpasses that of the regular version, hence their prefix <em>Grand</em> and their refined appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Obtaining Sanguine Items</strong></p>
<p><img align="right" height="176" hspace="4" onclick="window.open('https://static.tibia.com/images/news/rb2781_atdh_su23_framed.png', 'altar', 'width=482, height=354')" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/rb2781_atdh_su23_framed_small.png" style="cursor: pointer;" vspace="4" width="240"/>The new best-in-slot items can drop in a <em>bag you covet</em> from Bakragore's four children. Taints will raise this drop chance. <br/>Upon defeating Bakragore for the first time, you have an increased chance to drop a <em>bag you covet</em>. This chance will keep on increasing further with every kill until you loot a bag from him. Then, your drop chance returns to its original value which is considerably lower than the increased first-kill chance. Each time you subsequently defeat him without receiving a bag, your chances increase again till your next drop.</p>
<p>Bearing taints also gives you the chance to loot <em>tainted hearts</em> and <em>darklight hearts</em> from regular monsters in Rotten Blood. The higher the number of taints, the higher their drop chance. So, what is their purpose?<br/>Once you have killed Bakragore for the first time, you can use an altar in the Blood Vestibule for a crimson offering:<br/>If you sacrifice 5 tainted hearts, 5 darklight hearts and 50,000,000 gold, you will obtain a <em>bag you covet</em> including a best-in-slot item.</p>
<p>Defeating Bakragore while suffering from his burden is the only way to have a chance at looting the grand versions of the new best-in-slot weapons. The higher the burden stage, the higher the chance to loot a best-in-slot item from Bakragore and the higher the chance for the weapons to drop as a grand version.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion Scrolls</strong></p>
<p>There is another magnificent treasure you can seize from Bakragore: promotion scrolls. The smallest one grants your character 3 promotion points which you can spend in your Wheel of Destiny, the most powerful one bestows a whopping 20 points on your character. </p>
<center><img height="35 align=" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/rb3891_prop_su23.png" width="161"/></center>
<p>The higher the burden stage in your fight, the greater the chance to loot a more potent scroll from Bakragore. Each character above level 51 can only use each type of scroll once, so in total a character can gain 50 additional promotion points this way.</p>
<p>Of course, there are more valuables and accomplishments which you can bring back with you from this defiled place. We hope you are eager to explore Rotten Blood, to push your limits and reap the glory.</p>
<p>To the adventurous and the brave, <br/>To the inquisitive and the curious, <br/>To the stalwart and unyielding who venture to their edge and beyond,</p>
<p>This is your calling.</p>

<p>Have you been too busy fighting to notice the piles of gold sitting right next to you? Lost track of how many bodies are stacked up on the battleground? Let our <strong>Loot Highlight</strong> feature be your guide to glory and riches. This new feature visually highlights every unlooted corpse. For the first 10 seconds, only authorised looters can see it. If at least one corpse in a stack is unlooted, the stack/field will remain highlighted. The <strong>Loot Highlight</strong> will persist until one of the following three conditions is fulfilled: There was an interaction with the corpse via quickloot, the container of the corpse has been opened, or the corpse underwent decomposition, leading to an uncontainerised state. The <strong>Loot Highlight </strong>is optional and can be disabled by going to Options and selecting Interface   Gamewindow.</p>
<p><img align="right" height="180" hspace="10" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/bt_gb.png" vspace="10" width="110"/></p>
<p>The <strong>Bosstiary Tracker</strong> is another addition that operates in a similar manner to the established Bestiary Tracker. This widget streamlines the process of monitoring your progress with preselected bosses, specifically those that have been defeated at least once. Handpick your favourite bosses from the Cyclopedia and unleash your righteous fury upon them. </p>
<p><img align="left" height="145" hspace="10" src="https://static.tibia.com/images/news/container_goldenborder.png" vspace="10" width="314"/></p>
<p>Finally, we have added a new feature that helps to organise items obtained from NPC traders or the stash, by simply assigning specific items to preselected containers. You can access this feature in the Options menu under Misc and Gameplay, where you will find two new options named <strong>Auto-Sort Purchases</strong> and <strong>Auto-Sort Stash into Containers</strong>. These options are enabled by default. As part of this change, the Manage Loot Containers option will also be renamed to Manage Containers.</p>
<p>We hope that these convenience features will be welcomed additions!<br/>Your Community Managers</p>
